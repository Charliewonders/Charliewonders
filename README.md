# Hi, I'm Charlie 👋  

I’m passionate about building, learning, and exploring how technology shapes the future.  
Right now, I’m diving into **Web3, AI, and open-source projects** — creating simple yet meaningful contributions that grow into bigger ideas.

- Open-source contributions that solve real problems  

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
